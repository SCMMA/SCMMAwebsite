                    <p class="news-excerpt">This past weekend, SCMMA's own Zach Freeman secured a spectacular victory at
                        the regional MMA championship, submitting his opponent in the second round with a perfectly
                        executed rear-naked choke. This win marks Freeman's fifth consecutive victory and puts him in
                        contention for a title shot later this year.</p>
                    <p class="news-excerpt">"The training at SCMMA prepared me perfectly for this fight," Freeman said
                        after his victory. "Coach Mike's game plan was spot on, and the entire team's support was
                        incredible. I couldn't have done it without them."</p>
